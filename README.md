# Empath

**Empath** is a cross-platform application for job search, resume building, article publishing, and interview preparation â€” built entirely with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). The project is in active development and serves as both a real-world product prototype and an architectural playground.

---

## Project Goals

- Explore Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) in a full-scale application targeting **Android**, **iOS**, and **Desktop**.
- Compare modern architectural solutions (e.g., Decompose, Gradle Convention Plugins) with traditional Android stack used in commercial projects.
- Build a reusable, scalable project template based on **Clean Architecture** and **feature-based modularization**.
- Improve architectural thinking and developer visibility beyond platform boundaries.

## Tech Stack

### Core:
- **Kotlin Multiplatform** â€“ Shared codebase across Android, iOS, Desktop.
- **Clean Architecture** â€“ Clear separation of concerns across layers.
- **Modularization** â€“ Feature-based modular structure for scalability and maintainability.

### Infrastructure:
- **Gradle Convention Plugins** â€“ Standardized build logic and dependency management.
- **Koin** â€“ Dependency injection framework.
- **Ktor + Ktorfit** â€“ Typed REST client built on top of Ktor for network communication.
- **DataStore** â€“ Multiplatform key-value storage.
- **Coil** â€“ Image loading.

### Architecture & Navigation:
- **Decompose** â€“ Navigation + MVI for all KMP targets.

### Design:
- **Figma UI Kit** â€“ Design system created in Figma
